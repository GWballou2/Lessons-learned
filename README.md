# Lessons-learned
1. Html
2. css
3. javascript
4. github
5. I learned that what i am learning is really really depressingly hard. That is freaking awesome. Why you might ask? Great question! That means the competition is likely few in the grand scheme of things. job security and so on. I figure it takes a good years worth of repition of what ill learn before i become automated in all that i do. that is really really cool. i like that type of comfort. It takes a bit to lock something inside of my mind but once its there it wont ever leave. ill be speaking code in my sleep and responding to my servers at restaraunts in css3. Ha.
